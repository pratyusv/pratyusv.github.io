`Sorted String Tables` are immutable files which contains arbitrary, `sorted key-value pairs`, persisted on the disk. When `Memtables` are flushed from memory to disk, they are stored as SSTables. 

SSTables support fast sequential read/writes. As SSTables are sorted sequence of key-value pair, an index-file is maintained for fast retrieval. To retrieve data from SSTable, a binary search can be performed on the index to locate the offeset of the value. The index partition is also stored in the disk.

Example:

<br/>
<div>
    <center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/sstable/table.png"></center>
</div>
<br/>

For fast read, an `partition index summary` file is maintained which maps the key-range to the offsets.

Recently accessed SSTables offsets are stored in cache:`key cache`. 
It maps `Key` $$\rightarrow$$ `Byte offset`

### Reads

* When a read request arrives, it is first checked against the `Memtable`, if found the value is returned
* Look up in `key cache`, if found in key cache the disk is read for the specified offset and value is returned.
* Perform binary serach lookup in `primary index summary` to find the offset. The offset will give the location of `index file`. From the `index file`, the disk offset can be found. The disk is read for that offset and value is returned.

## Compactions

As SSTables are immutable, they can grow in size to a very huge amount. `Compaction` helps compress the SSTables. 


Compaction is operation of merging multiple related SSTables into a single new one. During compaction, the data in SSTables is merged: 
* the keys are merged
* columns are combined
* obsolete values are discarded
* a new index is created 

After compaction is performed the data is written into a new SSTable and the older SSTables are delete from the disk.
